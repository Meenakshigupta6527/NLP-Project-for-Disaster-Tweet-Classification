# NLP-Project-for-Disaster-Tweet-Classification

The challenge is to build a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying tweets as either related to real disasters or not.

Natural language processing (NLP) is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interaction between computers and humans in natural language. The ultimate goal of NLP is to help computers understand language as well as we do. It is the driving force behind things like virtual assistants, speech recognition, sentiment analysis, automatic text summarization, machine translation and much more.

In today's digital age, social media platforms like Twitter play a crucial role in disseminating information, especially during emergencies and disasters. However, distinguishing between tweets that genuinely indicate a disaster and those that do not can be challenging, even for humans. As a result, there is growing interest from various organizations, such as disaster relief agencies and news outlets, in developing automated methods to monitor Twitter for real-time disaster alerts.
